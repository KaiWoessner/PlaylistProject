This project uses a combination of Jupyter Notebook, Python, and the Spotify API to generate a randomized song (out of 390,000+ songs) based on an inputted release year range and genre. The songs can then be added to a playlist that will appear on the user's Spotify account. Jupyter Notebook was used to clean and analyze the dataset and Python was used in conjuction with the Spotify API to connect the program to the user's Spotify account. There is also a refined python program that contains a sklearn machine learning model using cosine similarity to recommend songs based on whether the user indicates if they like the song. The recorded data is then applied to a song dataset with over 1.2 million songs. Each time the user signals that they like a song, the amount of viable songs systematically shrinks. After 15 "like" iterations, a playlist of the user's top 20 songs is created in Spotify. The program input is entirely recorded in a refined Tkinter UI.
